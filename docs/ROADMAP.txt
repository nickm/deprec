deprec 2.0 roadmap

# expectations/constraints

- all tasks should be re-runnable
- all install_ tasks should install required dependancies
- users should expect that standard cap commands will work


# interactive tools

deprec should make it easy to perform commonly use sysadmin tasks.
While automation brings great power it's still often quicker to
run 'semi automated' tasks that require some interactive input.

For example, adding a user account to a number of servers could be
made easier with a general purpose interactive recipe:

cap add_user
> username for new user? : fred
> password for new user? : ******
> retype password        : ******
> user type for new user?
1. default
2. admin
?: 2
creating...
server01 - created user 'fred' of type 'admin'
server02 - created user 'fred' of type 'admin'
server03 - created user 'fred' of type 'admin'
server04 - user 'fred' exists. Set type to 'admin'

* Note that the servers above were all servers mentioned in deploy.rb
  for a project however there are many ways to get this list.


Plugin support for different distro's was too ambitious. I've tried other
distros and didn't like them much. I'm happy with Ubuntu at the moment and
# # plugin based support different distros, versions (and possibly OS's)
#
# While deprec was built to work with Ubuntu 6.06, some people have shown interest
# in using it with other distro's. I plan to move all of the Ubuntu specific code
# into a separate gem 'deprec_ubuntu' which deprec will load by default. This will
# mean anyone else can create and maintain plugins that allow the use of other linux
# distros (and perhaps other OS's).
#
# All platform dependent functions will be:
#
# - cap extensions, not tasks
# - plugins, not part of the deprec itself
# - loaded using gemplugins http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/gem_plugin_rdoc/index.html
#
# I'd like 'cap -T' to show the distros supported for each command when not arch independant.


# add lots more useful tasks

I'd like to extend deprec beyond just getting your rails app up and running.
Anything I need that takes some time to do right will go in. If you've got
something you want added then write it and let me know.

install and configure the following package groups:
- source control (svn, trac)
- mail (postfix, imap, mutt, mailx)


# don't rely on third party servers to be available when installing software

As I write, www.apache.org is serving at a crawling pace. I'd like to make it easy for
users to download and cache all required third party apps, gems, etc and have deprec
use these.

Currently you can drop the tarballs into /usr/local/src on the target server and
they'll get picked up automatically. I haven't looked at a simple way to cache the gems yet.
